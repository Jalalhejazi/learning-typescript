# JavaScript Features (with TypeScript)

Since TypeScript supports everything in the current ECMAScript specification, we're going to go over the existing JavaScript features quickly and transition to new features available in ES2015 and beyond, which are also supported in TypeScript. These features are all transpiled to ES5, while others not covered here need to target ES6 (this will be covered in a future chapter).

## Features

01. ES5 (current version) - `function`, `var`, array methods, etc.
02. `let` and `const`
03. Classes (Static, Public/Private, Property Types)
04. Arrow Functions
05. Template Strings
06. Object Literals
07. Destructuring
08. Default and Rest Parameters
09. Spread Operator
10. Iterators and `for..of`
11. Decorators
12. Map and forEach
13. Reduce
14. Filter
15. Combining map-reduce-filter in one line of code
16. Set() to remove duplicates
17. Object() everything in JavaScript is made of Object
