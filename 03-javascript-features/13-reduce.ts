/*
    Just like .map(), .reduce() also runs a callback for each element of an array. 
    Whatâ€™s different here is that reduce passes the result of this callback (the accumulator) from one array element to the other.
    The accumulator can be pretty much anything (integer, string, object, etc.) and must be instantiated or passed when calling .reduce().
